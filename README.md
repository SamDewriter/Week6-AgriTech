# Week6-LiDARCloud

<p>Th USGS recently released high resolution elevation data as a lidar point cloud called USGS 3DEP in a public dataset on Amazon. This dataset is essential to build models of water flow and predict plant health and maize harvest. 

This is an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. The code in this repository interfaces with USGS 3DEP and fetch data using their API.
